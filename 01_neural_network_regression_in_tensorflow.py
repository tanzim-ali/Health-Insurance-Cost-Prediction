# 01. Neural Network Regression with TensorFlow

There are many definitions for a [regression problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) but in our case, we're going to simplify it to be: predicting a number.

For example, you might want to:
- Predict the selling price of houses given information about them (such as number of rooms, size, number of bathrooms).
- Predict the coordinates of a bounding box of an item in an image.
- Predict the cost of medical insurance for an individual given their demographics (age, sex, gender, race).

In this notebook, we're going to set the foundations for how you can take a sample of inputs (this is your data), build a neural network to discover patterns in those inputs and then make a prediction (in the form of a number) based on those inputs.

## What we're going to cover

Specifically, we're going to go through doing the following with TensorFlow:
- Architecture of a regression model
- Input shapes and output shapes
  - `X`: features/data (inputs)
  - `y`: labels (outputs)
- Creating custom data to view and fit
- Steps in modelling
  - Creating a model
  - Compiling a model
    - Defining a loss function
    - Setting up an optimizer
    - Creating evaluation metrics
  - Fitting a model (getting it to find patterns in our data)
- Evaluating a model
  - Visualizng the model ("visualize, visualize, visualize")
  - Looking at training curves
  - Compare predictions to ground truth (using our evaluation metrics)
- Saving a model (so we can use it later)
- Loading a model

Don't worry if none of these make sense now, we're going to go through each.

## How you can use this notebook

You can read through the descriptions and the code (it should all run), but there's a better option.

Write all of the code yourself.

Yes. I'm serious. Create a new notebook, and rewrite each line by yourself. Investigate it, see if you can break it, why does it break?

You don't have to write the text descriptions but writing the code yourself is a great way to get hands-on experience.

Don't worry if you make mistakes, we all do. The way to get better and make less mistakes is to **write more code**.

## Typical architecture of a regresison neural network

The word *typical* is on purpose.

Why?

Because there are many different ways (actually, there's almost an infinite number of ways) to write neural networks.

But the following is a generic setup for ingesting a collection of numbers, finding patterns in them and then outputting some kind of target number.

Yes, the previous sentence is vague but we'll see this in action shortly.

| **Hyperparameter** | **Typical value** |
| --- | --- |
| Input layer shape | Same shape as number of features (e.g. 3 for # bedrooms, # bathrooms, # car spaces in housing price prediction) |
| Hidden layer(s) | Problem specific, minimum = 1, maximum = unlimited |
| Neurons per hidden layer | Problem specific, generally 10 to 100 |
| Output layer shape | Same shape as desired prediction shape (e.g. 1 for house price) |
| Hidden activation | Usually [ReLU](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/rectified-linear-units-relu-in-deep-learning) (rectified linear unit) |
| Output activation | None, ReLU, logistic/tanh |
| Loss function | [MSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error) (mean square error) or [MAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error) (mean absolute error)/Huber (combination of MAE/MSE) if outliers |
| Optimizer | [SGD](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/SGD) (stochastic gradient descent), [Adam](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Adam) |

*Table 1: Typical architecture of a regression network. Source: Adapted from page 293 of [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow Book by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)*

Again, if you're new to neural networks and deep learning in general, much of the above table won't make sense. But don't worry, we'll be getting hands-on with all of it soon.

> ðŸ”‘ **Note:** A **hyperparameter** in machine learning is something a data analyst or developer can set themselves, where as a **parameter** usually describes something a model learns on its own (a value not explicitly set by an analyst).

Okay, enough talk, let's get started writing code.

To use TensorFlow, we'll import it as the common alias `tf` (short for TensorFlow).

Or how about if `X` was -10.0?

This kind of pattern discovery is the essence of what we'll be building neural networks to do for us.

## Regression input shapes and output shapes

One of the most important concepts when working with neural networks are the input and output shapes.

The **input shape** is the shape of your data that goes into the model.

The **output shape** is the shape of your data you want to come out of your model.

These will differ depending on the problem you're working on.

Neural networks accept numbers and output numbers. These numbers are typically represented as tensors (or arrays).

Before, we created data using NumPy arrays, but we could do the same with tensors.
"""

# Example input and output shapes of a regression model

"""Our goal here will be to use `X` to predict `y`.

"""

# Take a single example of X
input_shape = X[0].shape

# Take a single example of y
output_shape = y[0].shape

input_shape, output_shape # these are both scalars (no shape)

"""Huh?

From this it seems our inputs and outputs have no shape?

How could that be?

It's because no matter what kind of data we pass to our model, it's always going to take as input and return as output some kind of tensor.

But in our case because of our dataset (only 2 small lists of numbers), we're looking at a special kind of tensor, more specifically a rank 0 tensor or a scalar.
"""

# Let's take a look at the single examples invidually
X[0], y[0]

"""In our case, we're trying to build a model to predict the pattern between `X[0]` equalling `-7.0` and `y[0]` equalling `3.0`.

So now we get our answer, we're trying to use 1 `X` value to predict 1 `y` value.

You might be thinking, "this seems pretty complicated for just predicting a straight line...".

And you'd be right.

But the concepts we're covering here, the concepts of input and output shapes to a model are fundamental.

In fact, they're probably two of the things you'll spend the most time on when you work with neural networks: **making sure your input and outputs are in the correct shape**.

If it doesn't make sense now, we'll see plenty more examples later on (soon you'll notice the input and output shapes can be almost anything you can imagine).

![example of input and output shapes for a housing price prediction problem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/main/images/01-input-and-output-shapes-housing-prices.png)
*If you were working on building a machine learning algorithm for predicting housing prices, your inputs may be number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms and number of garages, giving you an input shape of 3 (3 different features). And since you're trying to predict the price of the house, your output shape would be 1.*

## Steps in modelling with TensorFlow

Now we know what data we have as well as the input and output shapes, let's see how we'd build a neural network to model it.

In TensorFlow, there are typically 3 fundamental steps to creating and training a model.

1. **Creating a model** - piece together the layers of a neural network yourself (using the [Functional](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/functional) or [Sequential API](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential)) or import a previously built model (known as transfer learning).
2. **Compiling a model** - defining how a models performance should be measured (loss/metrics) as well as defining how it should improve (optimizer).
3. **Fitting a model** - letting the model try to find patterns in the data (how does `X` get to `y`).

Let's see these in action using the [Keras Sequential API](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential) to build a model for our regression data. And then we'll step through each.

> **Note:** If you're using [TensorFlow 2.7.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.7.0)+, the `fit()` function no longer upscales input data to go from `(batch_size, )` to `(batch_size, 1)`. To fix this, you'll need to expand the dimension of input data using `tf.expand_dims(input_data, axis=-1)`.
>
> In our case, this means instead of using `model.fit(X, y, epochs=5)`, use `model.fit(tf.expand_dims(X, axis=-1), y, epochs=5)`.
"""

# Set random seed
tf.random.set_seed(42)

# Create a model using the Sequential API
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss=tf.keras.losses.mae, # mae is short for mean absolute error
              optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(), # SGD is short for stochastic gradient descent
              metrics=["mae"])

# Fit the model
# model.fit(X, y, epochs=5) # this will break with TensorFlow 2.7.0+
model.fit(tf.expand_dims(X, axis=-1), y, epochs=5)

"""Boom!

We've just trained a model to figure out the patterns between `X` and `y`.

How do you think it went?
"""

# Check out X and y
X, y

"""What do you think the outcome should be if we passed our model an `X` value of 17.0?"""

# Make a prediction with the model
model.predict([17.0])

"""It doesn't go very well... it should've output something close to 27.0.

> ðŸ¤” **Question:** What's Keras? I thought we were working with TensorFlow but every time we write TensorFlow code, `keras` comes after `tf` (e.g. `tf.keras.layers.Dense()`)?

Before TensorFlow 2.0+, [Keras](https://keras.io/) was an API designed to be able to build deep learning models with ease. Since TensorFlow 2.0+, its functionality has been tightly integrated within the TensorFlow library.

## Improving a model

How do you think you'd improve upon our current model?

If you guessed by tweaking some of the things we did above, you'd be correct.

To improve our model, we alter almost every part of the 3 steps we went through before.

1. **Creating a model** - here you might want to add more layers, increase the number of hidden units (also called neurons) within each layer, change the activation functions of each layer.
2. **Compiling a model** - you might want to choose optimization function or perhaps change the **learning rate** of the optimization function.
3. **Fitting a model** - perhaps you could fit a model for more **epochs** (leave it training for longer) or on more data (give the model more examples to learn from).

![various options you can use to improve a neural network model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/main/images/02-improving-a-model-from-model-perspective.png)
*There are many different ways to potentially improve a neural network. Some of the most common include: increasing the number of layers (making the network deeper), increasing the number of hidden units (making the network wider) and changing the learning rate. Because these values are all human-changeable, they're referred to as [hyperparameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_(machine_learning)) and the practice of trying to find the best hyperparameters is referred to as [hyperparameter tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization).*

Woah. We just introduced a bunch of possible steps. The important thing to remember is how you alter each of these will depend on the problem you're working on.

And the good thing is, over the next few problems, we'll get hands-on with all of them.

For now, let's keep it simple, all we'll do is train our model for longer (everything else will stay the same).
"""

# Set random seed
tf.random.set_seed(42)

# Create a model (same as above)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile model (same as above)
model.compile(loss=tf.keras.losses.mae,
              optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(),
              metrics=["mae"])

# Fit model (this time we'll train for longer)
model.fit(tf.expand_dims(X, axis=-1), y, epochs=100) # train for 100 epochs not 10

"""You might've noticed the loss value decrease from before (and keep decreasing as the number of epochs gets higher).

What do you think this means for when we make a prediction with our model?

How about we try predict on 17.0 again?
"""

# Remind ourselves of what X and y are
X, y

# Try and predict what y would be if X was 17.0
model.predict([17.0]) # the right answer is 27.0 (y = X + 10)

"""Much better!

We got closer this time. But we could still be better.

Now we've trained a model, how could we evaluate it?

## Evaluating a model

A typical workflow you'll go through when building neural networks is:

```
Build a model -> evaluate it -> build (tweak) a model -> evaulate it -> build (tweak) a model -> evaluate it...
```

The tweaking comes from maybe not building a model from scratch but adjusting an existing one.

### Visualize, visualize, visualize

When it comes to evaluation, you'll want to remember the words: "visualize, visualize, visualize."

This is because you're probably better looking at something (doing) than you are thinking about something.

It's a good idea to visualize:
* **The data** - what data are you working with? What does it look like?
* **The model itself** - what does the architecture look like? What are the different shapes?
* **The training of a model** - how does a model perform while it learns?
* **The predictions of a model** - how do the predictions of a model line up against the ground truth (the original labels)?

Let's start by visualizing the model.

But first, we'll create a little bit of a bigger dataset and a new model we can use (it'll be the same as before, but the more practice the better).
"""

# Make a bigger dataset
X = np.arange(-100, 100, 4)
X

# Make labels for the dataset (adhering to the same pattern as before)
y = np.arange(-90, 110, 4)
y

"""Since $y=X+10$, we could make the labels like so:"""

# Same result as above
y = X + 10
y

"""## Split data into training/test set

One of the other most common and important steps in a machine learning project is creating a training and test set (and when required, a validation set).

Each set serves a specific purpose:
* **Training set** - the model learns from this data, which is typically 70-80% of the total data available (like the course materials you study during the semester).
* **Validation set** - the model gets tuned on this data, which is typically 10-15% of the total data available (like the practice exam you take before the final exam).
* **Test set** - the model gets evaluated on this data to test what it has learned, it's typically 10-15% of the total data available (like the final exam you take at the end of the semester).

For now, we'll just use a training and test set, this means we'll have a dataset for our model to learn on as well as be evaluated on.

We can create them by splitting our `X` and `y` arrays.

> ðŸ”‘ **Note:** When dealing with real-world data, this step is typically done right at the start of a project (the test set should always be kept separate from all other data). We want our model to learn on training data and then evaluate it on test data to get an indication of how well it **generalizes** to unseen examples.

len(X)

Two of the main metrics used for regression problems are:
* **Mean absolute error (MAE)** - the mean difference between each of the predictions.
* **Mean squared error (MSE)** - the squared mean difference between of the predictions (use if larger errors are more detrimental than smaller errors).

The lower each of these values, the better.

1. **Get more data** - get more examples for your model to train on (more opportunities to learn patterns).
2. **Make your model larger (use a more complex model)** - this might come in the form of more layers or more hidden units in each layer.
3. **Train for longer** - give your model more of a chance to find the patterns in the data.

Since we created our dataset, we could easily make more data but this isn't always the case when you're working with real-world datasets.

So let's take a look at how we can improve our model using 2 and 3.

To do so, we'll build 3 models and compare their results:
1. `model_1` - same as original model, 1 layer, trained for 100 epochs.
2. `model_2` - 2 layers, trained for 100 epochs.
3. `model_3` - 2 layers, trained for 500 epochs.

And now, you might be thinking, "wow, comparing models is tedious..." and it definitely can be, we've only compared 3 models here.

But this is part of what machine learning modelling is about, trying many different combinations of models and seeing which performs best.

Each model you build is a small experiment.

> ðŸ”‘ **Note:** One of your main goals should be to minimize the time between your experiments. The more experiments you do, the more things you'll figure out which don't work and in turn, get closer to figuring out what does work. Remember the machine learning practitioner's motto: "experiment, experiment, experiment".

Another thing you'll also find is what you thought may work (such as training a model for longer) may not always work and the exact opposite is also often the case.

## Tracking your experiments

One really good habit to get into is tracking your modelling experiments to see which perform better than others.

We've done a simple version of this above (keeping the results in different variables).

> ðŸ“– **Resource:** But as you build more models, you'll want to look into using tools such as:
* [**TensorBoard**](https://tensorboard.dev/) - a component of the TensorFlow library to help track modelling experiments (we'll see this later).
* [**Weights & Biases**](https://www.wandb.com/) - a tool for tracking all kinds of machine learning experiments (the good news for Weights & Biases is it plugs into TensorBoard).

## Saving a model

Once you've trained a model and found one which performs to your liking, you'll probably want to save it for use elsewhere (like a web application or mobile device).

You can save a TensorFlow/Keras model using [`model.save()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load#save_the_entire_model).

There are two ways to save a model in TensorFlow:
1. The [SavedModel format](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load#savedmodel_format) (default).
2. The [HDF5 format](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load#hdf5_format).

The main difference between the two is the SavedModel is automatically able to save custom objects (such as special layers) without additional modifications when loading the model back in.

Which one should you use?

It depends on your situation but the SavedModel format will suffice most of the time.

Both methods use the same method call.
"""

# Save a model using the HDF5 format

"""## Preprocessing data (normalization and standardization)

A common practice when working with neural networks is to make sure all of the data you pass to them is in the range 0 to 1.

This practice is called **normalization** (scaling all values from their original range to, e.g. between 0 and 100,000 to be between 0 and 1).

There is another process call **standardization** which converts all of your data to unit variance and 0 mean.

These two practices are often part of a preprocessing pipeline (a series of functions to prepare your data for use with neural networks).

Knowing this, some of the major steps you'll take to preprocess your data for a neural network include:
* Turning all of your data to numbers (a neural network can't handle strings).
* Making sure your data is in the right shape (verifying input and output shapes).
* [**Feature scaling**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#preprocessing-scaler):
    * Normalizing data (making sure all values are between 0 and 1). This is done by subtracting the minimum value then dividing by the maximum value minus the minimum. This is also referred to as min-max scaling.
    * Standardization (making sure all values have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1). This is done by subtracting the mean value from the target feature and then dividing it by the standard deviation.
    * Which one should you use?
      * **With neural networks you'll tend to favour normalization** as they tend to prefer values between 0 and 1 (you'll see this espcially with image processing), however, you'll often find a neural network can perform pretty well with minimal feature scaling.

> ðŸ“– **Resource:** For more on preprocessing data, I'd recommend reading the following resources:
* [Scikit-Learn's documentation on preprocessing data](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#preprocessing-data).
* [Scale, Standardize or Normalize with Scikit-Learn by Jeff Hale](https://towardsdatascience.com/scale-standardize-or-normalize-with-scikit-learn-6ccc7d176a02).

Also, the results may change if we were to alter the architectures of the models, e.g. more hidden units per layer or more layers.

## ðŸ›  Exercises

We've a covered a whole lot pretty quickly.

So now it's time to have a **play around** with a few things and start to build up your intuition.

I emphasise the words play around because that's very important. Try a few things out, run the code and see what happens.

1. Create your own regression dataset (or make the one we created in "Create data to view and fit" bigger) and build fit a model to it.
2. Try building a neural network with 4 Dense layers and fitting it to your own regression dataset, how does it perform?
3. Try and improve the results we got on the insurance dataset, some things you might want to try include:
  * Building a larger model (how does one with 4 dense layers go?).
  * Increasing the number of units in each layer.
  * Lookup the documentation of [Adam](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Adam) and find out what the first parameter is, what happens if you increase it by 10x?
  * What happens if you train for longer (say 300 epochs instead of 200)?
4. Import the [Boston pricing dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/boston_housing/load_data) from TensorFlow [`tf.keras.datasets`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets) and model it.

* Reading: 1-hour of [Chapter 1 of Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) by Michael Nielson - a great in-depth and hands-on example of the intuition behind neural networks.

To practice your regression modelling with TensorFlow, I'd also encourage you to look through [Lion Bridge's collection of datasets](https://lionbridge.ai/datasets/) or [Kaggle's datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/data), find a regression dataset which sparks your interest and try to model.
